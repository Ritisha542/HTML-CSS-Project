                    JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with
                    first-class functions.
                    While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments
                    also use it,
                    such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
                    garbage-collected,
                    dynamic language, supporting multiple paradigms such as imperative, functional, and object-oriented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists,
                    function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and
                    Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be
                    retrieved through toString()).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific
                        to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web
                        pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.

                        Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language — JavaScript is not "Interpreted
                        Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the
                        U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax,
                        semantics, and use.

            <article>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
                your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
            </article>
        </section>
        <section id="Variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                    The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
                    rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                    dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                    Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                    "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                    (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                    identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                    characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                    Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
