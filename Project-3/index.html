            Landscape painting, also known as landscape art, 
            is the depiction in painting of natural scenery 
            such as mountains, valleys, rivers, trees, and 
            forests, especially where the main subject is a wide 
            view—with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. 
            In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still 
            form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always 
            included in the view, and weather is often an element of 
            the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject 
            are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there 
            is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects.
            Two main traditions spring from Western painting and Chinese art, 
            going back well over a thousand years in both cases. 
            The recognition of a spiritual element in landscape art is 
            present from its beginnings in East Asian art, drawing on 
            Daoism and other philosophical traditions, but in the West 
            only becomes explicit with Romanticism.
